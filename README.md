This is a hobby project to implement the Bitcoin blockchain. 

It uses SHA-256 hashing algorithm and Javascript. It uses Redis, Postman for API testing, React and Bootstrap. It was implemented using Test based development. It also simultaneously uses Jest framework to test the program

This was implemented based on the guidance from a Udemy course and the MERN stack certification that I did.
